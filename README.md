Loan Appraisal for FNB Bank 
You are a credit analyst working for FNB Bank. Your responsibilities include analysing the loan 
applications and making recommendations to management, based upon your findings, to help them 
make data-driven decisions on lending. 
“Loan.csv” file includes data on 40,000 FNB customers that were granted a loan in the past and the 
respective outcome, i.e. whether they were identified as “write-offs” or “not write-offs”.
