# Loan Appraisal for FNB Bank

You are a credit analyst working for FNB Bank. Your responsibilities include analysing the loan applications and making recommendations to management, based upon your findings, to help them make data-driven decisions on lending.

**"Loan.csv"** file includes data on 40,000 FNB customers that were granted a loan in the past and the respective outcome, i.e. whether they were identified as "write-offs" or "not write-offs".

Using this data, analyse the new loan applications whose data are provided in **"NewApplications.csv"** and try to predict whether each new applicant will repay the requested loan if it is approved.
